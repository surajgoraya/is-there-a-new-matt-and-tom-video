# Is there a new Matt and Tom video?
Are you missing your weekly dose of ramble? This (absolutely useless) website checks to see if [Matt and Tom](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRUULstZRWS1lDvJBzHnkXA) have uploaded a new video! It also recommends you a random Matt and Tom video if they haven't!

# Why?
I was bored out of my mind and thought I'd give a shot at trying to mess with the YouTube API and Javascript to create a little web thing.

# Tech
* HTML5 - with Bootstrap
* CSS3
* Javascript - with JQuery

# Is it live somewhere?
~Yep, [over at my website under the projects page!](http://surajgoraya.ca/projects/mattandtom)~

Nope :(, this project has been archived and is no longer on my site. See: [surajgoraya.ca/archived](https://surajgoraya.ca/archived) for more details, if needed.
